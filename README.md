# Bamazon

Technologies Used: JavaScript, Node.js, and MySQL

Logic: Bamazon is an interactive shopping application that allows the user to select an item. Once the item is selected, the user will be prompted to specify how many of the product they would like to buy. Once the user selects the product and quantity, the application will check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
